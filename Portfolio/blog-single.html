                    <p class="mb-30">Sometimes, when the world seem like hell, even though nothing is still changed... I still think of the world as hell.
                      So, whenever i feel like dying and, & getting over it already, the only thing that makes me feel back alive is if i turn on my computer fron sleep and opened my
                      google doc to start typing the shits i'm going through... I start typing and i never raise my finger on the keyboard until tha feeling of wanting to leave all the people that
                      love me in this world finally goes away.</p>
                    <p class="mb-30">I didn't realize what i was doing at first... Only that i knew somehow that typing what i'm going through at some point if my life makes me...
                      It makes me feel like a heavy weight has been lifted off my chase. And the thing is, if you'll ever ask me how i do it, i don't think i'll ever have an answer 
                      to that. Because, it was not some sort of a plan for me to someday publish a book or anything like that.</p>
                    <blockquote>If you are still looking for that one person who will change your life, take a look in the mirror.</blockquote>
                    <p class="mb-30">When i was writting my pages, it was like... It was more like me writting it just to lift the weight that i feel off my body.
                        Because,
                      Life...
                        <br>Life is just.. "Life isn't fair" okay? <br>And i know some people might disagree with me on this but yeah. Life is indeed not fair sometimes, or perhaps, all the time.<br>
                       Yeah and if you really think i'm wrong and that life is fair then, you really should consider looking around and having just even a peak at some other people's life and maybe, just maybe. Then
                        you're likely to understand what i'm saying.
                      <br>So, the truth is, i never actually turned back around to read any of those pages that i was writting when i was writting them. I just, i just kept going.. 
                        At first when i started, i thought of it as a very dumb idea because a friend of mine who's so much into literature got me into it.
                       <br> She told me that she does same thing over and over whenver she feels angry, sad or even happy. And yeah, so i started. From writting a page 
                        a day to three pages, and then to 10 pages to even
                      typing 20 pages in a day. <br>It just changes my entire mood whenever i start typing. To a point in my life where i don't even wanna stop writting anymore.
                     I just write whatever that comes into my head, be it my story or just a scenerio that i want to happen to me. Yeah, just like..
                        My imaginations along side the reality that i face, to even the people that i meet on a daily basis.</p>
